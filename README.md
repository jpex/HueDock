HueDock
================

HueDock is an experiment in UI design and front-end development. This repository is focused on the latter.

__Preview__: http://jpex.github.io/HueDock/

###HTML###
Vanilla HTML is used without support of back-end languages, frameworks, or libraries. These exclusions mentioned are essential to a modern day web application, but muddy the scope of the project. Demonstrating competence in vanilla HTML without the aid of common add ons is the goal.

###CSS###
SCSS is used in favor of vanilla CSS, but no framework is used beyond a reset file.

###No JavaScript###
While this project would inevitably use JavaScript to interact with the interface, it is beyond the scope of the project's goals. HTML and CSS is the primary focus.
